## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is powered by a carefully selected set of technologies:

- **React**:  
  A leading JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. We chose React for its component-based architecture, which simplifies the development of single-page applications like this chatbot website, and its vibrant ecosystem.

- **Material-UI**:  
  A React UI framework that brings Google's Material Design to life. Material-UI was selected for its pre-built, customizable components, enabling rapid development and a polished, consistent design across the app.

- **TypeScript**:  
  A statically typed superset of JavaScript. We opted for TypeScript to enhance code quality, catch errors during development, and improve maintainability‚Äîcrucial for a project with multiple features like authentication and API interactions.

**Why this stack?**  
The combination of React, Material-UI, and TypeScript delivers a robust, scalable, and visually appealing frontend. React provides flexibility, Material-UI ensures a modern look, and TypeScript adds reliability‚Äîperfect for a user-facing chatbot application.

## üîê Authentication Context

The `AuthContext` is the backbone of user authentication in this project. It manages the authentication state globally and provides methods for login, signup, logout, and status checks.

### Key Features:
- **State Management**: Tracks `isLoggedIn` (boolean) and `user` (name and email).
- **Functions**:
  - **`login(email: string, password: string)`**: Authenticates a user and updates the state.
  - **`signup(name: string, email: string, password: string)`**: Registers a new user and logs them in.
  - **`logout()`**: Clears the user session and reloads the app.
  - **`checkAuthStatus()`**: Verifies authentication on app load (e.g., via cookies).

### How It Works:
The context uses React's `createContext` and `useState` to maintain the authentication state. On initialization, it checks the user's status with the backend, ensuring a smooth experience for returning users.
